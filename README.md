- 👋 Hi, I’m Thabang aka @iarxii
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Developement, Gaming and Dame Dev, Music, Digital Media Production and I am in love with all things visual art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js, Advanced PHP and full-stack web developement, a little bit of Unreal Engine for my future in the game developement industry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an annual project called Project.Adapt where I hope to bring young and talented people to work on developing digital platforms, products and services.
- 📫 If you are interested in getting in touch with me, you can send me an email (admin@adaptivconcept.co.za) or send me a WhatsApp message (+27 81 811 8095).
